day 1 part 2

Mathematica says XXXX (typo size -> six)

XXXX is too high



ok, finally got agreement: XXXX


XXXX is still too high?

so lame









day 3


XXXX is too low


it is XXXX, was not counting numbers at end of line







day 5 part 2

0 is not correct lol

the entries may not all be contiguous!

so add new entries to make them all contiguous, and make sure to add them correctly
